	    		<p> Known as cattails or punks in North America and bullrush and reedmace in England, <br>
				the typha genus of plants is usually found near the edges of freshwater wetlands. <br>
				Cattails were a staple in the diet of many Native American tribes. Most of a cattail is edible. <br>
				You can boil or eat raw the rootstock, or rhizomes, of the plant. The rootstock is usually found underground. <br>
				Make sure to wash off all the mud. The best part of the stem is near the bottom where the plant is mainly white. <br>
				Either boil or eat the stem raw. Boil the leaves like you would spinach. <br>
				The corn dog-looking female flower spike can be broken off and eaten <br>
				like corn on the cob in the early summer when the plant is first developing. It actually has a corn-like taste to it.
